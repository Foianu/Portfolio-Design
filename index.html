                    <p>My name is Valentina, I work in Design Industry for 7 years; I have worked for 4 years in 3D Architectural Design and Graphic Design.</p>
                    <p>My free time was filled up with modeling for my Portfolio, but also modeling some hard surface projects for Gaming Industry.</p>
                    <p>Over the years I have discovered Illustration Design and I managed to combine it with my Graphic Design skills and that is how <a href="https://www.instagram.com/val.n.tinaf/" target="_blank">" Music Simulation Collection "</a> was born.</p>
                    <p>I also expanded my vision and designed a few UI/UX design prototypes, which led me to learn <a href="https://github.com/Foianu" target="_blank">Web Design</a>. With this experiment I created some websites.</p>
                    <p>Learning new programs is my way of playing games.</p>
                    <p>Last year another experiment got my attention, I disassembled old phones for fun and I thought to start a new project. It is called <a href="https://www.tablou.tech/" target="_blank">tablou.tech</a> and it became a passion and a business.</p>
                    <p>I am currently working as a Freelancer and provide <a href="https://www.ui-deal.com/" target="_blank">design services</a>.</p>

                    <p>Being comfortable with using Photoshop, for my previous years of photo editing, I really started learning Graphic Design 7 years ago, at the same time I was learning 3D modeling.</p>
                    <p>Between 2020 and 2022, working from home, I had more energy and no additional project, so I learned Illustration Design. My firsts drafts were illustrated coloring books, mandalas, and logos.</p>

                    <p>Last year, looking for a new way to present my work, I thought it would be a great idea to blend my illustrations with Packaging Design.</p>
                    <p>My goal here was to find a suitable solution to change my approach to showing my skills in a clear and easily detectable way.</p>
                    <p>My long-term work in progress project, " Music Simulation Collection " is a way of creating a product.</p>

                    <p>My Voxel Collection was a project I started a few years ago because I wanted to strengthen my modeling skills and discover other hidden ideas.</p>

                    <p>My favorite things as a child were building houses out of plasticine, playing Sims just to decorate the houses, doing puzzles, and drawing. So my 4-year job was like a dream come true. From there I was able to expand my creative abilities, trying new things.</p>
                    <p>Working in 3D Architectural Design Industry, I started to like Interior Design too. So I worked on my portfolio and played with my ideas.</p>
                    <p>I was curious about each object I introduced into my scene, this made me start learning the structure of each object.</p>

                    <p>Planning, Organizing, Data Analysis - It was the perfect setup to develop my skills, so I gave it a try and created user interfaces , after I took a few UI/UX courses.</p>
                    <p>The challenge was to see if I was able to feel comfortable with the entire design process and observe my learning process to improve it.</p>
                    <p>Another thing I wanted to observe and strengthen was my problem-solving skills.</p>

                    <p>This side of Design opened up new perspectives for me. I learned the importance of user experience.</p>
                    <p>My first project was a case study (Builder) where I went through all the steps I learned.</p>
                    <p>Of course, I was curious to implement all my recent knowledge into a real project. This is why I started learning Web Design. It is fulfilling to be able to turn an idea into reality, into something useful.</p>

                    <p>This was the easiest and most interesting project I have ever worked on.</p>
                    <p>From building the template in Illustrator, researching the phone parts, and disassembling phones to learning the phone assembly process ( just because ).</p>
                    <p>The goal was to create a product to sell and enter the business world.</p>
                    <p>Product design has earned a place in my free time.</p>
                    <p>This brings me to my next chapter, I had to learn some Branding Design while creating User Interfaces projects, Product Design project and other drafts.</p>
                    <p>Creating a project from scratch requires commitment, work, openness. The plan was to achieve all of these while building something solid.</p>
                    <p>For me, art is a way of living, a way out, a way to develop myself everyday, so at this point it has become a tool I use daily.</p>
